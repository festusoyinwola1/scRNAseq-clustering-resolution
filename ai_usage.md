# AI Usage Documentation

This project used ChatGPT and Google Gemini to support the development and debugging of the computational workflow. 
AI tools were used only for explanatory and troubleshooting purposes, not for performing any analysis.

## How AI Was Used
- Clarifying the purpose and function of Scanpy commands and parameters  
- Helping debug error messages during clustering and UMAP generation  
- Explaining how to structure the GitHub repository for reproducibility  
- Assisting in writing and formatting the draft project proposal and draft report  
- Providing guidance on best practices for documentation (README, ai_usage.md, repo structure)

## What AI Did NOT Do
- AI did not generate or modify any dataset  
- AI did not execute any analysis code (all code was run manually in Google Colab / Jupyter environments)  
- AI did not create figures, UMAPs, or clustering outputs  
- AI did not make decisions about parameter selection or scientific interpretation

All computations, clustering analyses, and figure generation are performed manually in Python using Scanpy.  
Prompts, responses, and verification notes will be included in the final project submission for transparency.

## Verification of AI Output
Whenever AI provided code explanations or debugging suggestions, all changes were independently validated by:
- Running the code directly in the Jupyter notebook  
- Checking outputs for correctness  
- Reviewing parameter effects on clustering  
- Ensuring reproducibility through Git and GitHub history

This file fulfills the project requirement to document AI usage clearly and transparently.
