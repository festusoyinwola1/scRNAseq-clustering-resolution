# AI Usage Documentation

This project used ChatGPT and Google Gemini to:
- Debug errors in Scanpy workflows
- Clarify code behavior and parameter choices
- Explain methods and workflow steps

All computations, clustering, and figure generation will be done independently in Python.
Prompts and AI-generated outputs will be included in the final report for transparency.
